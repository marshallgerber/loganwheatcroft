        Cardboard: Should You Eat It?
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A vaguely structured and entirely uneducated analysis of the potential benefits of chewing, digesting, and excreting cardboard, the widely used packaging material. 
        </p>

        <h2>Pros (Mostly Silly)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="pro">It tastes delicious*</span> It has an excellent, earthy flavor and a sometimes crispy, sometimes chewy texture.</li>
            <li><span class="pro">Low calories</span> It contains basically nothing digestible, so it will come out exactly as it came in, just broken down.</li>
            <li><span class="pro">High in “fiber”</span> Technically, but not the edible kind your body can use. You might have a chance if you are fervid.</li>
            <li><span class="pro">Widely available</span> The boxes should fear me. I am coming for them. They are everywhere so I will find them. There is nothing they can do.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cons (Actual Reality)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="con">Not food.</span> Your body cannot properly digest cardboard.</li>
            <li><span class="con">Possible choking hazard?</span></li>
            <li><span class="con">May contain inks, glues, dyes, or chemicals</span> that are generally unsafe to consume.</li>
            <li><span class="con">Zero nutritional value.</span> It doesn’t provide vitamins, minerals, or usable fiber.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
            Eating cardboard is pretty unsafe and not recommended by most medical professionals, but I personally enjoy the taste and have been eating it for years. At the end of the day, this is a personal decision for you to make. Plenty of people make decisions that are not advisable for personal reasons, such as the use of airbags, which historically kill more people than they save.
